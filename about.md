I'm a data scientist and solar energy scientist with a PhD in Physics.  I'm interested in solving today's problems with data.  I would love to hear about what you are doing with your data!  Please reach out at scott<dot>alan<dot>little<at>gmail<dot>com to get the conversation started.

Also, you can [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottalanlittle/) or follow the other links at the bottom of the page to see what else I am up to these days.
